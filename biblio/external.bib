	abstract = {Gene expression data analysis is challenging due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the data. Feature selection, which identifies relevant genes, is a common preprocessing step. We propose a Comprehensive Learning-Based Swarm Optimization (CLBSO) approach for feature selection in gene expression data. CLBSO leverages the strengths of ants and grasshoppers to efficiently explore the high-dimensional search space. Ants perform local search and leave pheromone trails to guide the swarm, while grasshoppers use their ability to jump long distances to explore new regions and avoid local optima. The proposed approach was evaluated on several publicly available gene expression datasets and compared with state-of-the-art feature selection methods. CLBSO achieved an average accuracy improvement of 15\% over the original high-dimensional data and outperformed other feature selection methods by up to 10\%. For instance, in the Pancreatic cancer dataset, CLBSO achieved 97.2\% accuracy, significantly higher than XGBoost-MOGA's 84.0\%. Convergence analysis showed CLBSO required fewer iterations to reach optimal solutions. Statistical analysis confirmed significant performance improvements, and stability analysis demonstrated consistent gene subset selection across different runs. These findings highlight the robustness and efficacy of CLBSO in handling complex gene expression datasets, making it a valuable tool for enhancing classification tasks in bioinformatics.},

	abstract = {Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) are considered for use in renewable residential DC microgrids. This architecture is shown as a technically feasible solution to deal with the stochasticity of renewable energy sources, however, the complexity of its design and management increases inexorably. To address this problem, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based energy management system (EMS) for use in grid-connected residential DC microgrids with HESS. It is a hydrogen-based HESS, composed of batteries and multi-stack fuel cell system. The proposed EMS is based on a multivariable and multistage fuzzy logic controller, specially designed to cope with a multi-objective problem whose solution increases the microgrid performance in terms of efficiency, operating costs, and lifespan of the HESS. The proposed EMS considers the power balance in the microgrid and its prediction, the performance and degradation of its subsystems, as well as the main electricity grid costs. This article assesses the performance of the developed EMS with respect to three reference EMSs present in the literature: the widely used dual-band hysteresis and two based on multi-objective model predictive control. Simulation results show an increase in the performance of the microgrid from a technical and economic point of view.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for tracking Maximum Power Point (MPP) in stand-alone photovoltaic system. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is one of approaches which boost efficiency of PhotoVoltaic (PV) cells by the load matching between the PV cells and the load. The key problem is that maximum power is not achieved because PV cells power is affected by weather conditions such as the solar irradiation and the temperature, thus, the MPP is changed during daylight hours and year seasons. Therefore, it is necessary to design an appropriate controller based on one of techniques to track MPP. These techniques are based on true or estimated searching mechanism to MPP. True searching mechanism based techniques like incremental conductance method and perturb and observe method are efficient but they are less stable, more oscillatory about MPP and sensitive to a high frequency noise. Generally, estimated searching mechanism based techniques like constant voltage method and fractional open circuit voltage method are less efficient, but they are stable and no sensitive to a high frequency noise. In this paper, the ANFIS-reference model method in addition to the incremental conductance method and constant voltage method have been studied, designed and implemented using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board to compare the performance of each method. The proposed ANFIS-reference model controller is efficient since it has been trained offline using Matlab tool with practical data sets. Based on our knowledge, this paper is the first paper which introduces practical implementation of ANFIS-reference model based MPPT for photovoltaic system using FPGA board. The results reveal that the ANFIS-reference model controller has more efficient and better dynamic response than the incremental conductance method and constant voltage method.},

	abstract = {Label distribution learning is a widely studied supervised learning diagram that can handle the problem of label ambiguity. The increasing size of datasets is accompanied by the disaster of dimensionality, which implies that the arrival of redundant and noisy features undermines the effect of label distribution learning. As a crucial data-preprocessing technique, feature selection is capable of choosing discriminative features. However, due to the complex issue of label ambiguity, traditional feature selection approaches for datasets with logical labels cannot be applied to label distribution data. In this paper, a novel granular ball computing-based fuzzy rough set (GBFRS) is proposed for label distribution feature selection. Specifically, the proposed method is first introduced at the finest granularity, i.e., calculating similarity relations between single data points. Considering that the label ambiguity issue is exacerbated by the label imbalance phenomenon, the relative similarity in label distribution space among samples is computed for better generalization of the model. Then, a robust approximation strategy is devised for the target sample by using its true different and partially different class samples. Finally, with the concept of granular balls, the method explores the similarity relations between balls and samples, and the granular ball computing-based fuzzy rough set method is developed , which is endowed with the ability to simulate the characteristics of large-scale priorities in human thinking and considers local consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on twenty-two datasets show that GBFRS can effectively select more significant features than seven state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy inference system (FIS) is one of the most used approaches in decision making and machine learning models. The main advantage of this system is that it can process data in the fuzzy form whose exact value is unknown. Various FIS models are available in the literature. The most common FIS models are Mamdani and Sugeno type models. In Sugeno type FISs, the output of each rule should be given as a specific mathematical function. Sometimes these functions can be difficult to identify. In the Mamdani model, it is sufficient to give an approximate fuzzy set instead of the specific function as a rule output. The overall output of the Mamdani type model is the aggregated fuzzy set, which is an aggregation of individual rule outputs. But in this composite set, the contours of each rule output are lost and the effect on the overall output is not very obvious. A novel type FIS with rule-based defuzzification (FIS-RBD) is proposed in this study. This model is a Mamdani type FIS, however, the defuzzification process is applied to each rule's output instead of the overall output. The overall output of the system is calculated as the weighted average of the defuzzified values of the rule outputs. This approach is a synthesis of a Mamdani type and Sugeno type models. In the study, the details of the proposed approach are examined and the working principle is explained with numerical examples.},

	abstract = {The AI community is increasingly putting its attention towards combining symbolic and neural approaches, as it is often argued that the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are complementary. One recent trend in the literature is weakly supervised learning techniques that employ operators from fuzzy logics. In particular, these use prior background knowledge described in such logics to help the training of a neural network from unlabeled and noisy data. By interpreting logical symbols using neural networks, this background knowledge can be added to regular loss functions, hence making reasoning a part of learning. We study, both formally and empirically, how a large collection of logical operators from the fuzzy logic literature behave in a differentiable learning setting. We find that many of these operators, including some of the most well-known, are highly unsuitable in this setting. A further finding concerns the treatment of implication in these fuzzy logics, and shows a strong imbalance between gradients driven by the antecedent and the consequent of the implication. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of fuzzy implications (called sigmoidal implications) to tackle this phenomenon. Finally, we empirically show that it is possible to use Differentiable Fuzzy Logics for semi-supervised learning, and compare how different operators behave in practice. We find that, to achieve the largest performance improvement over a supervised baseline, we have to resort to non-standard combinations of logical operators which perform well in learning, but no longer satisfy the usual logical laws.},

Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.}

	abstract = {Non-singleton fuzzification is used in rule-based fuzzy systems when the measurements that activate them are imperfect or uncertain or when their inputs are words. It models such measurements or words as fuzzy numbers or more general fuzzy sets so that, regardless of the cause of a measurement's or word's imperfections or uncertainties, they are treated within the framework of fuzzy sets and systems. Since 2011, there has been a resurgence of interest in both type-1 and interval type-2 non-singleton fuzzy systems. This paper removes a computational bottleneck associated with computing the firing level or firing interval for such fuzzy systems, by providing closed-form formulas for them when the involved fuzzy sets are trapezoidal or triangular, which are widely used fuzzy sets. This is done for both the minimum and product t-norms. It is also demonstrated that a non-singleton fuzzy system that uses the product t-norm has the potential to outperform a non-singleton fuzzy system that uses the minimum t-norm. The results in this paper greatly simplify non-singleton fuzzy systems, which should make them much more popular.},

Accordingly, the chapter has a full application dimension of the FTS models as a main vocation. The R program was used to fit and forecast the principal FTS models, where real datasets of road traffic accidents in Algeria have been used. This chapter is organized as follows; the first section presents the concept of fuzzy logic, the second section is devoted to the Fuzzy Time Series, where we define a fuzzy set and universe of discourse. The third section summarizes the main models of fuzzy time series, precisely; we presented the (Song \& Chissom, 1993) model, the (Chen, 1996) model, the Heuristic (Huarng, 2001) model, the (Abbasov \& Mamedova, 2003) model, the (Chen \& Hsu, 2004) model, and the (Singh, 2008) model. The fourth section is a case application of these models on the number of accidents in Algeria; the "AnalyzeTS" package of the R program was used to demonstrate the steps of estimation and forecasting.},

Participatory learning assumes that learning and beliefs about a system depend on what the learning mechanism knows about the system itself. The basic learning mechanisms rely on online clustering and parameter estimation using least squares algorithms. Evolving fuzzy participatory learning (ePL) modeling adopts the same scheme as evolving Takagi-Sugeno (eTS) modeling. After the initialization phase, data processing is performed at each step to verify whether a new cluster must be created, an old cluster should be modified to account for the new data, or redundant clusters must be eliminated. Computational experiments with a classic benchmark problem and a real-world application concerning hourly electrical load forecasting show that ePL is a promising approach in the adaptive fuzzy systems modeling area.

First, the historical data are fuzzified into differential fuzzy sets, and then differential fuzzy relationships are calculated. Second, differential fuzzy logic groups are established by grouping differential fuzzy relationships. Finally, in the defuzzification step, the forecasts are calculated. However, for increasing the accuracy of the models, an evolutionary algorithm, namely imperialist competitive algorithm is injected, to train the model.
